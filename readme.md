# ðŸ§° Blender MyScripts

A collection of custom Blender scripts by me, **Millenne Noel**, built to streamline and automate common workflow tasks in 3D projects. From quick object cleanup to batch renaming, material management, and procedural prefab tools.

---

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This repository contains a growing toolkit of Blender scripts designed for:
- Faster **object and mesh cleanup**
- Efficient **batch renaming**
- Easier **material assignment and management**
- Automation of **scene organization**
- Utility tools for **prefab workflows** and **OSM-based projects**

All scripts are designed for **Blender 4.0+** and can be installed as individual add-ons or run directly from the **Text Editor**.
